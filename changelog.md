# Changelog

This is the changelog for Cluck Guard. While this project does not have a large software side, it does have a big hardware and documentation side to it. Therefore, much of the changelog will be related to this as well.

## [0.10] - 2023-07-25

### Added

- Stopper to pulley (plumbers strap and screw)
    - See [stopper.gif](images/stopper.gif)
    - Updated [README.md](README.md) accordingly

## [0.9] - 2023-07-13

### Fixed

- Pulley not having a long enough circumference.
    - Replaced pulley with a new one with a circumference of 14 inches.
