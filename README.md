# CluckGuard - Automatic Chicken Coop Door

CluckGuard is an automated chicken coop door that is designed to open and close automatically based on sunrise and sunset. With this device, you will no longer have to worry about letting your chickens out in the morning or locking them up at night. It is easy to install and operate, making it a perfect solution for any chicken owner.

This project is still a work in progress! Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/itsdombo/CluckGuard/wiki) and the [changelog](changelog.md) to see updates.

## Features

## Installation

To be written...

## Operation

Once installed, CluckGuard will automatically open and close the door based on the sunrise and sunset times. The device uses a photoresistor to determine when the sun is rising and setting, and adjusts the door accordingly. If you need to adjust the opening and closing times, you can do so by adjusting the parameters in the code.

## Maintenance

CluckGuard is designed to be low-maintenance and weather-resistant. However, it is important to periodically check the batteries (if plugged in with batteries) and ensure that the photoresistor is calibrated so the door closes at the right time of day.
